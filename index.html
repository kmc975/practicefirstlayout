                   <p>Hi, I am a UX/UI Designer with a B.S. in 
                    Applied Psychology and Sociology. 
                    I came across UX/UI by researching 
                    various fields related to my degree after 
                    I decided to make a switch from pursuing 
                    Psychiatry. I took an online course for UI during my undergrad and enjoyed it. I am excited to combine my degree in Psychology, Sociology, and UX/UI in order to create useful experiences. I need to make money somehow!</p>
